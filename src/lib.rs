//! libweave: a library for structured programming
//!
//! libweave is a rust-based, no-unsafe, Cxx-compliant library for structured programming.
//! libweave lets you work with graph-like data effortlessly and natively: instead of having
//! to write custom data structures and algorithms for traversing, pattern-matching, and
//! transforming data, it offers a rich library of generic tools that fit into any workflow.
